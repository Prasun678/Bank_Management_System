The Bank Management System project is designed to manage and streamline banking operations. It includes modules for customer account management, transaction processing, and financial reporting. Users can create, update, and delete customer accounts, process deposits and withdrawals, and generate account statements. The system ensures data security and accuracy through robust authentication and validation mechanisms. It supports various account types and facilitates loan processing and interest calculation. The project aims to enhance efficiency, reduce manual errors, and provide a user-friendly interface for both bank staff and customers, ultimately improving overall banking service quality.
